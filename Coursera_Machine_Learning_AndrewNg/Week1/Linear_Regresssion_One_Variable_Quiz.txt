1. Question 1
------------------
Consider the problem of predicting how well a student does in her second year of college/university, given how well 
she did in her first year. Specifically, let x be equal to the number of "A" grades (including A-. A and A+ grades) 
that a student receives in their first year of college (freshmen year). 
We would like to predict the value of y, which we define as the number of "A" grades they get in their second year 
(sophomore year).

Refer to the following training set of a small sample of different students' performances (note that this training set may 
also be referenced in other questions in this quiz). Here each row is one training example.
Recall that in linear regression, our hypothesis is hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x, and we use m to denote the number of training examples.


For the training set given above, what is the value of m? 
In the box below, please enter your answer (which should be a number between 0 and 10).

x|y
----
3|4
2|1
4|3
0|1

Answer: 4

2. Question 2
------------------
For this question, assume that we are using the training set from Q1. Recall our definition of the cost function was 
J(θ0,θ1)=1/2m∑mi=1(hθ(x(i))−y(i))2.

What is J(0,1)? In the box below, please enter your answer (Simplify fractions to decimals when entering answer, and '.' as the decimal delimiter e.g., 1.5).

Answer: J(0,1)=(1/2 * 4)((( θ0 + θ1*x1) - y1) + (( θ0 + θ1*x2) - y2) + (( θ0 + θ1*x3) - y3) + (( θ0 + θ1*x4) - y4))2

J(0,1)=(1/8)((( 0 + 3) - 4) + (( 0 + 2) - 1) + (( 0 + 4) - 3) + (( 0 + 0) - 1))2
   = 1/8 * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 4/8 = 0.5

3. Question 3
------------------
Suppose we set θ0=−1,θ1=2 in the linear regression hypothesis from Q1. What is hθ(6)?

Answer: 11( hθ(x) = θ0 + θ1x i.e. hθ(6) = θ0 + θ1*6 = -1 + 2 *6 = 11)

4. Question 4
------------------
Let f be some function so that f(θ0,θ1) outputs a number. For this problem, f is some arbitrary/unknown smooth function 
(not necessarily the cost function of linear regression, so f may have local optima).

Suppose we use gradient descent to try to minimize f(θ0,θ1) as a function of θ0 and θ1. Which of the following statements are true? (Check all that apply.)

1. If the first few iterations of gradient descent cause f(θ0,θ1) to increase rather than decrease, then the most likely cause is that we have set the

learning rate α to too large a value.

2. If θ0 and θ1 are initialized at the global minimum, then one iteration will not change their values.

3. No matter how θ0 and θ1 are initialized, so long as α is sufficiently small, we can safely expect gradient descent to converge
to the same solution.

4. Setting the learning rate α to be very small is not harmful, and can only speed up the convergence of gradient descent.

Answer:  
If the first few iterations of gradient descent cause f(θ0,θ1) to increase rather than decrease, then the most likely cause is that we have set the
learning rate α to too large a value
If θ0 and θ1 are initialized at the global minimum, then one iteration will not change their values.

5. Question 5
------------------
Suppose that for some linear regression problem (say, predicting housing prices as in the lecture), we have some training set, 
and for our training set we managed to find some θ0, θ1 such that J(θ0,θ1)=0.
Which of the statements below must then be true? (Check all that apply.)


1. We can perfectly predict the value of y even for new examples that we have not yet seen.
(e.g., we can perfectly predict prices of even new houses that we have not yet seen.)

2. For this to be true, we must have θ0=0 and θ1=0 so that hθ(x)=0

3. For these values of θ0 and θ1 that satisfy J(θ0,θ1)=0, we have that hθ(x(i))=y(i) for every training example (x(i),y(i))

4. This is not possible: By the definition of J(θ0,θ1), it is not possible for there to exist θ0 and θ1 so that J(θ0,θ1)=0

Answer: For these values of θ0 and θ1 that satisfy J(θ0,θ1)=0, we have that hθ(x(i))=y(i) for every training example (x(i),y(i))
